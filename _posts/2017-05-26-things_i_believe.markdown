I don’t believe in the way things work. I don’t believe in the education system, I don’t believe in the way the current housing market works, I don’t believe in the current health insurance market. About the only thing I believe gets it close to right is online shopping.

I think that consumers ought to drive the market; to that end, consumers should have to the tools and resources to do so. With regard to many markets, we still operate in the 20th century model of limited freedom. We create artificial scarcity for no reason and I think it makes everyone unhappy.

I like online shopping because I can go to Amazon and buy 20 different items from 8 individual stores in 5 minutes and get my stuff in 2 days. I never have a problem traveling to a physical store. I never have to worry about stock. I always get exactly what I want and nothing more. Amazon gives me to tools to help myself do this. I get my stuff at a competitive price, businesses move more product than they were previously able to, and Amazon gets a small cut for handling the sale. That’s economic symbiosis. Everyone wins.

But what about all the other markets? Anyone who has ever lived in a big city can tell you how hard it is to find housing. Ever tried buying a car? Dealerships hold all the cards. No need to even mention how jacked buying health insurance is. People struggle to find what they are looking for because no one makes it easy for them. I don’t think anybody wins when somebody loses and I think this is why so many markets are failing. 

I think we can make the world a better place by improving the way consumers interact with suppliers. I think companies like Amazon, Lyft, the Flatiron School, and a handful of others are showing us that it’s possible to make this happen in a way that works for everyone. The tool that links all these companies together is software. How they implement software separates them from other competitors in their markets. They use software to make products and services accessible, which makes them more desirable. As a consumer, I am happier to spend my money with these companies because they make it easy for me to get exactly what I want with no unnecessary bloat in between me and receiving that product.

To me, software development is a tool. A means to an end. I believe that good software puts control into the hands of consumers. I believe good software can drive up demand for products and services. Good software represents a dramatic shift in quality of life. I want to make the world a better place for people. I believe that software can make that happen.
