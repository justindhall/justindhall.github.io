MVC is all about getting things in the write spot. Models where they belong, views tucked away in their folders, controllers where they belong. It's an important part of understanding how to write clean and uniform code. It helps you remember where you left things and other programmers know where to find files in your application.

My app, Cook-This, leverages Sinatra's ability to navigate the MVC framework to create, display, update, and-if neceessary-remove recipes from a community recipe board. It's a simple concept that allows users to organize large applications and I put it to use in my project. 

Coming from a job where I have been building Rails micro-service APIs for the last few months, it's actually been a nice change of pace to get back to the basics. Strengthening our foundational understanding of a framework is important when it comes to building applications that need to be worked on by other people. If we want our work to outlast us, it's important that we accurately implement standardized processes. Getting to build this Sinatra application might have seemed simple compared to the other things I've built, but the beauty of MVC is it realy is just that simple.
